Like a [helicopter seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple#Morphology) or a [samara fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samara_(fruit)), wisps are tiny seedlings that one will find blowing about. 

They are fleeting thoughts and ideas that have not yet landed anywhere in particular. They may become sprouts or simply disappear in the wind.
