title: Jekyll-Bonsai

Jekyll-Bonsai is a jekyll theme built for digital gardeners. Most of the site's linking and internal structure is determined by markdown files and some extended markdown syntax. This shifts the design of the site from the web tools of html, css, javascript, or a front-end framework to plain markdown files. In turn, this lowers the technical barrier to deciding how to structure the pages on one's site.

It is still being built, but feel free to poke around.
