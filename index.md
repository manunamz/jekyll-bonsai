title: Jekyll-Bonsai

Jekyll-Bonsai is a jekyll theme built for digital gardeners. Most of the site's linking is determined by some extended markdown syntax. This shifts more of the tooling used in determining the site's design from the web tools of html, css, javascript, or a front-end framework to plain markdown files. In turn, this lowers the technical barrier to deciding how to structure the pages on one's site.

It is still being built, but feel free to poke around.
