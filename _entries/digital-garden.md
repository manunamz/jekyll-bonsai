The [digital gardens](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) mentioned in [[root]] are about developing new ways of structuring knowledge and navigating digital spaces. Techniques found in the wild[>i] are typically a mix derived from [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management), [personal wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki), [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), and [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) among others.[>me]

_[[digital-garden.bonsai|Bonsai]]_ is the culmination and curation of what I have learned and built.

[>i]: read as: the internet.

[>me]: Well, at least from what I've found...so far...😈
