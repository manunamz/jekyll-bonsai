Bonsai literally means "tray planting". It is the art of recreating a realistic picture of nature[>i] in miniaturized form. From the perspective of a site-[[people.creator]], they are seeding and pruning a `jekyll-bonsai` in a small [[features.site-nav.graph|tray-like]] space. The finer details are described well by the wikipedia article on bonsai:

> Purposes of bonsai are primarily contemplation for the [[people.visitors|viewer]], and the pleasant exercise of effort and ingenuity for the [[people.creator|grower]]. By contrast with other plant cultivation practices, bonsai is not intended for production of food or for medicine[>data]. Instead, bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping of one or more small trees growing in a [[features.site-nav.graph|container]]."
