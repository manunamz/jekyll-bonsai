Some [[feat.doc]]s, especially any documents being processed by `jekyll-namespaces`, require unique IDs. If the documents do not have IDs in their frontmatter the `jekyll-id` plugin may be added to ensure IDs exist, generate them for you if necessary, and can be added in `permalink`s. See the [docs](https://github.com/manunamz/jekyll-id) for more details.

⚠️ This plugin should not overwrite pre-existing data, but since this plugin will write directly to markdown files, be sure to backup all data before running this plugin.
