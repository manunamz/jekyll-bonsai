ğŸ§¹ Like [[digital-garden.sweep]]ing away their [[digital-garden.steps]], [[people.visitors]] can delete all visited data by clicking the broom in the bottom of the sidebar. This will reset the [[features.site-nav.visited]] site-nav and nodes' [[features.site-nav.graph.nodes.visited-status]] in the graph.
