As [[features.extended-syntax.wikilinks]], networked entry-taking apps, and graphs flower in popularity, a debate has also sparked between networks vs hierarchies. 

This template leverages both [[features.site-nav.graph.type.tree]]s (hierarchies) and [[features.site-nav.graph.type.net-web]]s (networks) so you and your [[people.visitors]] may toggle the perspective and decide for yourselves what works well[^data-structure].

[^data-structure]: Of course, the final experience will depend both on the graphs' inherent natures _and_ how the entries themselves are structured...
