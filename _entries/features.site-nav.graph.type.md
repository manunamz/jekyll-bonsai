As [[features.site-nav.graph.links.wikilinks]], networked note-taking apps, and graphs flower in popularity, a debate has also sparked between networks vs hierarchies. 

This template leverages both [[features.site-nav.graph.type.tree]]s (hierarchies) and [[features.site-nav.graph.type.net-web]]s (networks) so you and your [[people.visitors]] may toggle the perspective and decide for yourselves what works well[>data-structure].

[>data-structure]: Of course, the final experience will depend both on the graphs' inherent natures _and_ how the notes themselves are structured...[^sidenotes]

[^sidenotes]: Like the [[features.notes.note-body.sidenotes]]?
