[Digital gardens](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) are about developing new ways of structuring knowledge and navigating digital spaces. Techniques found in the wild are typically a mix derived from [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management), [personal wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki), [tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/), [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), and [evergreen notes](https://entries.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) among others.

_[[digi-gard.orient.bonsai|Bonsai]]_ is the culmination and curation of what this particular gardener has learned and built.
