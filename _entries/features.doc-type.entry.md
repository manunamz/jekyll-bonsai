Like entries in a dictionary, encylopedia, or wikipedia, entry documents are atomic concepts and ideas. Ideally they are meaningfully [[features.site-nav.graph.links|linked]] so as to understand how ideas relate to one another.

You can jump directly to entries via the [[features.site-nav.graph]] or by navigating its various parts (see child nodes).
