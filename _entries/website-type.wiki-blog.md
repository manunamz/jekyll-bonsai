metaphor::[[digi-gard]]


From this gardener's perspective, the new digital gardening phenomenon is the coalescing of wikis and blogs: Instead of a tag cloud, concepts can be viewed and navigated via a semantic [[feat.site-nav.graph.type.tree]] or concept [[feat.site-nav.graph.type.net-web|network]]. Single tags also do more than simply listing all posts. Tags map to a wiki-like entry which describes the concept in words and displays complex relationships via [[feat.doc.ext-synt.wikilinks]] and [[feat.doc.ext-synt.namespaces]].

At least, that's this incarnation's guiding philosophy.
