A [[features.doc-type|document's]] tags are the same as [jekyll tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/tags/) with the added bonus that they map to an [[features.doc-type.entry]] where the filename matches the tag name. 

This theme is optimized for tags in [[features.doc-type.post]], which allows visitors to hop from posts to entries.
