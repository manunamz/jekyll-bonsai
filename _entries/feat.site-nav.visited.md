metaphor::[[digi-gard.orient.step]]


As pages are [[feat.visit]]ted, each step is added as a tab to a list of visited pages. This makes it easy to re-visit previously seen areas. Tabs are ordered from most recent to least recently visited, top to bottom. Re-visited entries are moved to the top and removed from further down the stack.[^nog-fil]

This captures some of the functionality of the sliding behavior from [Andy's notes](https://entries.andymatuschak.org/About_these_entries), which help orient someone within the site.

### Navigate

To view visited pages, hover over the ðŸ§­ and click on ðŸ¥¾.

### Config

```yaml
bonsai:
  nav:
    visited:
      enabled: true
```

`visited.enabled`: Toggle on/off the visited tabs in the sidebar.
