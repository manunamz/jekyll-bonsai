Namespaces are defined by '.' delimeters in  filenames, [[features.doc-type.entry|entries]] in particular. For example, the breadcrumb [[features.doc-type.entry.head]] above the given content is formed by the current entry's filename, which is `features.site-nav.graph.links.namespacing.md`. 

Namespaces are built with the [[plugins.jekyll-namespaces]] plugin and are the building blocks for the [[features.site-nav.graph.type.tree]].
