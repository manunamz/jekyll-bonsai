ðŸ¥¾ As entries are [[features.visited]], each [[digital-garden.steps|step]] is added to the visited tab list, which makes it easy to re-visit previously seen entries. The resulting tab-links are organized via the [Noguchi Filing System](https://lifehacker.com/the-noguchi-filing-system-keeps-paper-documents-organiz-1593529432): Tabs are ordered from most recent to least recently visited; top to bottom. Re-visited entries are moved to the top and removed from further down the stack.

This captures some of the functionality of the sliding behavior from [Andy's Entrys](https://entries.andymatuschak.org/About_these_entries)[>click], which help orients visitors within the [[digital-garden]].

[>click]: Just click around in his entries to experience the slide.
