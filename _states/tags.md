The statuses here are for the types of foliage, fauna, and fruit in this garden. They reflect the spirit of lifecycle tagging, where the state represents the status of concept
[maturity](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Taxonomy_of_note_types) and perhaps its
[epistemic status](https://www.gwern.net/About#confidence-tags).
