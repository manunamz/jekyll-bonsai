Like a [helicopter seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple#Morphology) or a [samara fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samara_(fruit)), wisps are tiny seedlings that blow in the wind via [anemochory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_dispersal#Wind). 

They are fleeting thoughts and ideas that have not yet landed anywhere in particular. They may become sprouts or simply disappear in the wind.
