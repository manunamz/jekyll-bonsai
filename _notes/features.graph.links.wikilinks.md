\[\[Wikilinks]][>names] are are crucial part of the world of [[digital gardening|digital-garden]]. They are the basic building block of the interlinking accomplished in many gardens, including this one.

## Notable

- Wikilinks are green[>blue] and may be [[previewed on hover|features.graph.links.wikilinks.hover-preview]].
- This type of linking is what defines the links in the [[features.graph.type.net-web]] graph type.
- \[\[Wikilinks]] are rendered by the [[plugins.jekyll-wikilinks]] plugin.

## Influences

- [digital garden jekyll template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template), initial d3 implementation in jekyll.

## Proposal

- Would [jekyll](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/introducing-jekyll-wikilinks/6013) or kramdown be interested in integrating this plugin?
