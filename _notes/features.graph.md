The graph in the sidebar is the main site navigation for this template. Just click on a node and you'll be taken to it's corresponding [[note|features.notes]]. If you hover over the node, it's title will display as a tooltip. You can also click the ðŸŒ³ or ðŸ•¸ to toggle the graph's [[features.graph.type]].

You could think of the graph as a [[digital-garden.bonsai]] growing in the sidebar tray.

## Notable Quirks

- Graph gravity behavior is somewhat finicky -- it is likely its numerical values will need to be tinkered with directly to make your graph fit the sidebar.

## Influences

- [digital garden jekyll template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template), initial d3 implementation in jekyll.
