ðŸ¥¾ As notes are [[features.visited]], each one is added to a visited tab list, which makes it easy to re-visit previously seen notes. The resulting tab-links are organized via the [Noguchi Filing System](https://lifehacker.com/the-noguchi-filing-system-keeps-paper-documents-organiz-1593529432): Tabs are ordered from most recent to least recently visited; top to bottom. Re-visited notes are moved to the top and removed from further down the stack.

This captures some of the functionality of the sliding behavior from [Andy's Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)[>click], which help orients visitors within the [[digital-garden]].

[>click]: Just click around in his notes to experience the slide.
