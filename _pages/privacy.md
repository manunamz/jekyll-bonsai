👋 Hey there!

I want **YOU** to help me make this garden as awesome! If you agree 👍 to let me save some info about your visit, I can make this site _even_ better.

If that's too much to ask, then please consider giving some [feedback](https://github.com/manunamz/jekyll-bonsai/discussions/) or contributing some [fuel](https://ko-fi.com/manunamz/) for the gardener.

In case you change your mind either way, regardless if you accept or decline, the site will reset and ask you once a month if you're still interested in helping out. This page will also be here so you can set or reset.
