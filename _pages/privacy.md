👋 Hey there!

I want **YOU** to help me make this garden awesome! If you agree 👍 to let me save some info about your visit, I can make this site _even_ better.

If you opt out, please consider giving some [feedback](https://github.com/manunamz/jekyll-bonsai/discussions/) or contributing some [fuel](https://ko-fi.com/manunamz/) for the gardener.

Either way, regardless if you accept or decline, the site will reset occasionally to make sure we're on the same page about your interest in helping out.

Until the alternatives have been more thoroughly investigated, this site will use google analytics with anonymized ip addresses.
