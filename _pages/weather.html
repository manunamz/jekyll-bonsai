<h1>ðŸŒ¦ Weather "Back"cast</h1>
<p>
  Instead of a 'forecast' looking into the future, these are 'backcasts' peering into recent history. 
  It's featured posts, but version controlled. It's a feed, without infinite scroll. It's releases, with a chance of rain.
</p>
<p>
  Weather statuses are as follows:
</p>
<p style="line-height: 1;">ðŸŒ¤ Created</p>
<p style="line-height: 1;">ðŸŒ§ Updated</p>
<p style="line-height: 1; color: grey;"><em>ðŸŒ© Deleted (Currently not active)</em></p>

<hr>

{% assign recent_notes = site.notes | recent: site.recent %}
{% for note in recent_notes %}
  <p style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
    <!-- note.weather is a 'recent_notes'-specific data attribute -->
    <a class="wiki-link" href="{{ note.permalink }}">{{ note.weather }} {{ note.title }}</a>
    <span style="color: grey; float: right;">{{ note.updated | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}</span>
  </p>
{% endfor %}
