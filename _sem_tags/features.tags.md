Tags in this template are used to represents the status of a 
[note's maturity](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Taxonomy_of_note_types) and perhaps its
[epistemic status](https://www.gwern.net/About#confidence-tags), which are represented as [[digital-garden.plants]]. A survey of tags may be viewed on the [[features.pages.status-tags]] page.

Because tagging on the internet is not typically used in this fashion, this might change. But it's worth noting that this is a philosophy of tagging that has sprung up in the networked note taking world, which is [already colliding](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/allow-links-in-yaml-front-matter-notion-like-databases-from-metadata-links-as-first-class-citizens/10052) with how tags are used on the internet.
