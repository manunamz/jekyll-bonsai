If you are here, I presume you want to get straight to writing and potentially don't know much about `git`, `jekyll`, or the underlying technologies related to setting up this template.

### 0 GitHub

First, you'll want to [setup a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)

### 1 "Use This Template"

Go to the [`jekyll-bonsai-templ`](https://github.com/manunamz/jekyll-bonsai-templ) starter project and hit the big green "Use this template" button.

This will take you to a **"Create a new repository"** screen. Fill out given prompts -- "Repository name", "Description", etc. and then click the big green **"Create repository from template"** button.

You should now have a shiny new repo.

### 2 Back To Setup

Now head back to the [[2021-11-18-setup#Clone|clone instructions]] to run on your machine...
